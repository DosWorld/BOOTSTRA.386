A note about build issues:

This system seems to succeed on some systems and fail on others. I have spent a good amount of time trying to figure out the differences and decided to just throw in the towel for now. I'll change this in the future if I can get something more reliable. But if npm run start doesn't work for you then I'm sorry. If you can fix it in a general way, then please tell me!
